### About This Repository
Welcome to my repository showcasing the projects I completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Applied Capstone Course. This certificate programme provided comprehensive training in data science, covering topics such as data analysis, machine learning, Python programming, data visualisation, and working with databases. This repository contains notebooks for learning purposes. Some notebooks are adapted from IBM's original content and are provided here solely for personal and educational use.
